    "First, I want to give you a brief idea of how an API works. API stands for Application Programming Interface. Basically, the purpose of an API is to make it easier for any random person to scrape data from a specific site or database without having to go through a bunch of really technical, nitty gritty work. For example, Twitter and Facebook both have API's that let you scrape data about people's behavior on social media. Their API makes it much easier for people to gather data.\n",
